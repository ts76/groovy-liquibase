###May 25, 2015
We're pleased to announce that the Liquibase Groovy DSL is now a part of the
Liquibase organization.  I'll still maintain the code, it will just live in a 
different Git repository.  Bringing this project into the larger Liquibase 
family will help keep all things Liquibase together in one place and make the 
project easier to find for all Liquibase users. The new home for the Liquibase
Groovy DSL is https://github.com/liquibase/liquibase-groovy-dsl

I'll update existing issues in this repository as they get addressed, but new
issues should be reported in the new repository.

Thank you all for your continued support,

Steve Saliman
